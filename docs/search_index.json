The form of the dataset is as follows: a total of \\(4705\\) proteins, each one represented by a row, are enriched with GO annotations (a total of \\(8621\\) GO terms (Carbon et al. 2019)) that indicate the presence (\\(1\\)) or absence (\\(0\\)) of a particular molecular function. The dataset is provided as a tab-delimited file. In this analysis we present a 2D visualization of this dataset using the non-linear dimension reduction method UMAP (McInnes, Healy, and Melville 2018). This method will reduce the size of the dataset from \\((4705 \\times 8621)\\) to \\((4705 \\times 2)\\) while efficiently identifying groups of proteins with the same molecular characterization. These groups are indicated by varying size clusters in the 2D plane. Analysis See script umap.R for more details about the presented analysis.
